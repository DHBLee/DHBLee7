    text: `" Wow! Blown away by an explosion of deliciousness!
I wish there could be a sixth star for these ratings. The Italian food here - AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD - was no less than orgasmic. Perfect is not enough. From the deep fried fiori di zucca to the carpaccio, the pasta, oh my good, we were run over by an unexpected train of gorgeous flavours. This linguine alle vongole with grated bottarga was better than any similar I have had in Italy, or those that my mother and my grandfather used to prepare. I was so allured to it that completely forgot to get that picture taken. Perhaps the best Italian restaurant I have been to in Australia. Cannot say anything else. Perfect is just not enough. "`,
